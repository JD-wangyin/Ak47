Ak47 
=========

Ak47 is an easy [Network Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service) Testing Framework. It can support mostly network protocols, such as [HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), [Hession](http://hessian.caucho.com/), [ISO8583](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583), [Dubbo](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo), [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), and other [RPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) protocols. 

Its most novel feature is the integration of [Performance-Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_testing), [Mock-Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) and [Automation-Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation). By the 3-in-one design, cases can be written always in the same style and be easily migrated in the three scenes.

Ak47 is created and maintained by [JD-wangyin](https://github.com/JD-wangyin), with the help of [many contributors](https://github.com/JD-wangyin/ak47/graphs/contributors).
